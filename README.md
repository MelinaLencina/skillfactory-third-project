## How to run our site

For this tutorial on how to set up and run our project we recommend using Visual Studio Code with its integrated terminal.

##### One of the easiest ways to do this, is to do as follows:

First copy the repository HTTPS address.

|![HTTPS Address](./src/assets/images/https.jpg)

Then we should position ourselves in the directory we want our folder to be downloaded

Next, clone our repository using git clone + the HTTPS address.
Type in the Git terminal:

```
https://github.com/fyunes/skillfactory-third-project.git 
```

A folder will be created, access it by typing the following line in the terminal:

```
cd skillfactory-third-project
```

After that, you should install all dependencies for it to work properly running the following command:

```
npm install
```

If you do not wish to install them globally and to reduce long time issues you may also run:

```
npx install
```

###### Now you simply must enter

```
npm start
```

Then the app should start running smoothly without any issues.
